## Introduction
    IAP golang sample encapsulates APIs of the HUAWEI IAP server. It provides many sample programs for your reference or usage.
    The following describes sample code.
    
    config.go:           Sample code of config.
    atdemo.go:           Sample code of AccessToken. 
    order.go:            Sample code of OrderService. 
    subscription.go:     Sample code of SubscriptionService. 
    notification.go:     Sample code of notification.


## Configuration
    To use functions provided in examples, you need to set related parameters in Demo.go.
    
    The following describes parameters in class DemoConfig.
    ClientId:      Client ID, which is obtained from app information.
    ClientSecret:  Secret access key of an app, which is obtained from app information.

    ApplicationPublicKey:   Application RSA publick key, base64 encode string. 
    
    At first, the meaning of accountFlag should be clear.If field accountFlag in InappPurchaseData equals to 1, 
    the account belongs to telecom carrier(TOBTOC_SITE_URL), otherwise to Huawei(TOC_SITE_URL).  
    For both OrderService and SubscriptionService, you need to choose appropriate site.
    TOC_SITE_URL:      The TOC_SITE_URL has different urls at different sites, you should always choose the address of the nearest site to access.
    TOBTOC_SITE_URL:   The site for telecom carrier.
