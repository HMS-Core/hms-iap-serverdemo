## Introduction
    Ruby sample code encapsulates APIs of the HUAWEI IAP server. It provides many sample programs for your reference or usage.
    The following describes class of Ruby sample code.
    
    AtDemo:               Sample code of AccessToken. Each method can run independently.
    OrderService:         Sample code of OrderService. Each method can run independently.
    SubscriptionService:  Sample code of SubscriptionService. Each method can run independently.

## Installation
    Before using Ruby sample code, check whether the Ruby environment has been installed. 
    Decompress the Ruby sample code package.
    
    Copy the Ruby sample package in the decompressed folder to the project vendor directory .
    Refresh the project and ensure that the file is successfully copied to the destination directory.
    
## Supported Environments
	Ruby 2.6.5+ .  
    
## Configuration
    To use functions provided in examples, you need to set related parameters in at_demo.rb, order_service.rb 
    and subscription_service.rb in the package.
    
    The following describes parameters in at_demo.rb.
    CLIENT_ID:      Client ID, which is obtained from app information.
    CLIENT_SECRET:  Secret access key of an app, which is obtained from app information.
    TOKEN_URL:      URL for the Huawei OAuth 2.0 service to obtain a token, please refer to Generating an App-Level Access Token.
    
    At first, the meaning of accountFlag should be clear.If field accountFlag in InappPurchaseData equals to 1, 
    the account belongs to telecom carrier(TOBTOC_SITE_URL), otherwise to Huawei(TOC_SITE_URL).  
    For both OrderService and SubscriptionService, you need to choose appropriate site.
    TOC_SITE_URL:      The TOC_SITE_URL has different urls at different sites, you should always choose the address of the nearest site to access.
    TOBTOC_SITE_URL:   The site for telecom carrier.
